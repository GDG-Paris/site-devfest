I'm a Google Developer Expert who works as a Developer Advocate Engineer at Auth0. At Auth0 we're trying to make authentication and identification as easy as possible, while still keeping it secure.

After office hours I like to play around with the web-audio API, and other "exotic" browser APIs. One of my side projects is a library to add audio effects to an audio input using JavaScript.

When I'm not behind a computer, you can find me playing the guitar, having a beer at a concert, or trying to snap the next perfect picture.
