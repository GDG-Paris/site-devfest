Valériane had nothing to do with coding or anything related in her previous life, and she basically fell into computer science, internet, communities, philosophies and ethics at école 42.
She has learned web basics with Le wagon and started as freelancer in Paris right after.
Passionate about the startup ecosystem she has been a backend developer, consultant and deputy CTO for many and started talking in local meetups by the time.
Nowadays she writes about the techs she loves as a developer advocate for Clever Cloud and organizes the DevRelSalon meetup in Paris.
