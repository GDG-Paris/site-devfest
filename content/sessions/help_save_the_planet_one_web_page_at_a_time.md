The web has an ecological impact. We know it, that is a fact. As a concerned citizen and a web developer, I have been trying to reduce the webâ€™s impact for a year.

But what impact exactly? When it is time to estimate the impact, we are less confident.

Focusing on the Netflix login page, I will estimate the CO2 cost of this particular page following the requests through user devices, network and datacenters.

The audience will learn how to reduce their ecological impact as a web user and a web actor, and how to imagine the web of tomorrow.
