From git housekeeping to releasing. From keeping a sane backlog to
handling internationalization and monitoring status, the life of an app 
developer involves more than meets the eye.

This talk will be a feedback about how we use Kotlin extensively at
Dailymotion to automate our Android workflows:
* automate the dev workflows with clickt command-line apps on dev
machines.
* achieve CI independence with kotlin runners on CI machines.
* monitors App reviews with a custom Kotlin slack bot.
* ditch bash and perl and use kscript instead.

That's a lot to cover and the goal of this talk is not to dig into
each technology but more to inspire and show the range of possibles
opened by Kotlin.
