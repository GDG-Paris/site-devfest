Neural networks work in "mysterious ways", but we can now peer into some of them to see how they work. This talk focuses on a tool called Lucid, from the TensorFlow team, and aims to show some interesting examples of different ways of visualizing neural networks with the goal of improving explainability. You will come away with a bit more understanding of how neural networks "learn", and what aspects they are "looking" at.
